- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Vic a product designer, lover of photography and technology, based in Uruguay. 
Through my work, with a creative attitude to solve problems, curiosity, continuous learning, teamwork, and more than five years 
of experience in the design of products and services, I have helped companies to better communicate their values, improve the user 
experience linked to its products and services, through the use of inclusive user-centered design processes.
I love being able to use design in conjunction with technology to make people's lives easier and to contribute to continuous improvement and business growth.
